# linear_regression
Here is an example of the linear regression model, which is the basic algorithm used in machine learning.
The code is written in python3.
To execute the code, run the linear_regression.py program.
Can use train.csv to train the model and then test.csv to test it.
I have created another program to convert a csv file to array.
